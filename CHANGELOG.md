### BREAKING CHANGES

- The UMD release no longer includes babel-polyfill, you will need to include your own polyfills in order to support older browsers.

# 0.8.4

- Fix a bug when you use SortableHandle and distance prop [#447](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/447)

# 0.8.3

- Fix: TouchEvent is undefined in certain browsers, such as Safari [#382](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/382)

# 0.8.1

- Fix scrolling issues on mobile with anchor tag elements [#380](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/380)
- Update TypeScript type definition for ContainerGetter to accept Promises that return HTMLElements

# 0.8.0

- Allow `getContainer` to return a promise. This is useful when the container node is rendered by a parent component, since `componentDidMount` fires backwards (from child to parent) [#155](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/155/)

# 0.7.4

- Fix typo in getLockPixelOffset helper

# 0.7.3

- Fix issues with distance and pressThreshold props on mobile [#378](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/378)

# 0.7.2

- Fix issues with TypeScript type definitions

# 0.7.1

- Provide TypeScript type definitions out of the box [#377](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/377)
- Fix potential issues with calling `removeEventListeners` on `componentWillUnmount` if the container node has already unmounted [#376](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/376)

# 0.7.0

- [Breaking change] Removed lodash dependency. For users wishing to support Internet Explorer, a [polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find#Polyfill) for Array.prototype.find will be required
- Added `onSortOver` prop that gets invoked when sorting over an element [#278](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/278)
- Fix `useWindowAsScrollContainer` [#306](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/306)

# 0.6.8

Update react and react-dom peerdependency requirements for React 16+ [#283](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/283). Thanks [@jnsdls](https://github.com/jnsdls)!

# 0.6.7

Fixes issues with Jest Snapshot testing trying to serialize the `window` object and running out of memory [#249](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/249). Thanks [@cameronmcefee](https://github.com/cameronmcefee)!

# 0.6.6

Fixes an issue with Internet Explorer 11 introduced in `0.6.5` [#248](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/248). Thanks [@humiston](https://github.com/humiston)!

# 0.6.5

Fixes the position of the sortable helper when the page is scrolled [#213](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/213)

# 0.6.4

Fix: when cloning the element that is being sorted, we no longer update the value of cloned file inputs [#232](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/232)

# 0.6.3

Fixes issues caused by a disabled SortableElement being moved when `distance` is set to a value other than `0`

# 0.6.2

Use `prop-types` package for PropType validation for compatibility with React ^15.5

# 0.6.1

Tweak: default to `pointerEvents: none` on sortable helper, this way the underlying view can still be scrolled using the trackpad/mousewheel while sorting [#160](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/160)

# 0.6.0

Feature: added `pressThreshold` prop to make `pressDelay` fault tolerant [#159](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/159)

# 0.5.0

Tweak: `button` elements are now included in the default `shouldCancelStart` implementation [#142](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/142).
Fix: Omit `getHelperDimensions` before passing down props in `SortableContainer`

# 0.4.12

Thanks [@DeadHeadRussell](https://github.com/DeadHeadRussell)!

# 0.4.9

Fix: This release fixes a bug introduced in `0.4.8` caused by calling the `forEach` method directly on a NodeList, which is undefined in a number of browsers [#125](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/125)

# 0.4.8

Fix: Added logic to ensure that `select`, `input` and `textarea` fields in `SortableElement` always retain their `value` when the element is cloned (this happens when sorting begins) [#122](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/122) [#123](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/123). Thanks [@tomasztomys](https://github.com/tomasztomys)!

# 0.4.7

Fix: This release fixes a bug in Firefox caused by active anchor tags preventing mousemove events from being fired [#118](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/118)

# 0.4.5

Fix: getHelperDimensions height was not being used (Thanks [@SMenigat](https://github.com/SMenigat)!)

# 0.4.4

Tweak: cherry-picking lodash methods instead of importing the entire bundle (slipped by in a PR, thanks for pointing this out [@arackaf](https://github.com/arackaf)!)

Fixes an edge-case bug in Firefox where window.getComputedStyle() returns null inside an iframe with `display: none` [#106](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/106). Thanks [@funnel-mark](https://github.com/funnel-mark)!

# 0.4.2

Fixes an issue when attempting to sort items while rapidly moving the mouse. By setting an immediate timer, we move the cancel event to the tail of the timer queue, and ensure that it is fired after the pressTimer [#80](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/80). Thanks [@v0lkan](https://github.com/v0lkan)!
