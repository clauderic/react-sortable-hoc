### 0.6.2
Use `prop-types` package for PropType validation for compatibility with React ^15.5

### 0.6.0

Thanks []@DeadHeadRussell](https://github.com/DeadHeadRussell)!

### 0.4.8
Fix: Added logic to ensure that `select`, `input` and `textarea` fields in `SortableElement` always retain their `value` when the element is cloned (this happens when sorting begins) [#122](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/issues/122) [#123](https://github.com/clauderic/react-sortable-hoc/pull/123).

Thanks [@v0lkan](https://github.com/v0lkan)!
